# Spades+

A scorekeeping web app for the card game my family likes to play when we're all together. Kind of like Spades but with extra people. And a different scoring system. And no teams. And a bunch of other different stuff.

## Rules

Much like [this game](https://gamerules.com/rules/oh-hell-card-game/)[^1], but we changed a few things.

(Rules coming soon.)

[^1]: As you can see, I have slightly renamed it.
